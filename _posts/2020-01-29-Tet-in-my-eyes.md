<p class="intro">Hello, I'm Viet Hoang or you can call me Edward.I'm back again with this second post. As mentioned in the title this is about my recent Tet</p>
<blockquote >SHITs HAPPEN BUT SOMETIMES AND DOES NOT COME AT ONCE</blockquote>
Tết ([tet˧˥] or [təːt˧˥]), Vietnamese New Year, Vietnamese Lunar New Year or Tet Holiday, is the most important celebration in Vietnamese culture. The word is a shortened form of Tết Nguyên Đán (節元旦), which is Sino-Vietnamese for "Feast of the First Morning of the First Day". Tết celebrates the arrival of spring based on the Vietnamese calendar, which usually has the date falling in January or February in the Gregorian calendar.

### WHAT DIFFERENCE THIS YEAR
* I earned a little money for this year but cant use it for my family 
* Less Houseword cuz my mother had done some 
* so cold and we had sufferd a rock rain on the 30th night 
* No Gaming like the last year (not wasted time)

### HOW I SEE THIS HOLIDAY 
For me Tet is always confused time because it cause my schedule messed up. After a many conflict in my father-family,
Tet is troublesome like we cant talk with some cousins anymore. They came and we just greeted and back. I understand my parent's feeling. I don't hate that cousins for what they had done as well as my grandmother. However, everytime I recall that story, I lose all of my concentration. That escalated for years now and this year maybe at the peak. I believed that we will on that peak for long time. Damn it! 

On the other side, I have somewhat called acceptable Tet holiday because I had done something: I have a hangout with my homies on the second of Jan as usual, a party with them on the 5th, A outside activity with my high school friend on the 6th,....In our family, we really went to our mother's aunt this year (for the first time). During this holiday, I watched a lot of film and had a changes in my film style: Quentin's film which was really crazy

Being a twienty years old boy, when Tet is coming I realize that the time for me to be responsible for my career, family is coming. There no more lucky money in the next few years, I have to work to make money, have to answer some sensitive question like: "How is your salary", " Life pressure",....Therefore TET is not the time for me to enjoy anymore. I have to prepare for the future, think about how I will be, .... Yeah! A meaningful Tet!!!!

When I write this line, I still ambiguous about my future, wonder if I am right to choose this path. It's Life. I hope that the next year when I come back maybe this question will be clear. I still believe that this is the right way for me although on that path there are a lot of difficulties. Be Brave Boy!!!!!
