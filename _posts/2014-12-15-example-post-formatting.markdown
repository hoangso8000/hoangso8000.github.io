<p class="intro">Hello, I'm Viet Hoang or you can call me Edward. This first post in my blog is to help me to note what I had done, learned. Therefore in this post, I will tell you about my 2019</p>

<blockquote>Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Nulla vitae elit libero, a pharetra augue. Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Donec sed odio dui. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.</blockquote>

Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor.

## What I had done
* HFWTS
* VNP
* Bad Results at school

## Detail
HUST had slapped me hurtly after my first year and this first semester of this school-year. I struggled with the general subjects such as Math, Physics, ................ I keep in mind that it was worth learning and only focus on the programming. However, if i had done that truely, i would have been really content right now. Therefore, you know that I was all broke stress

Let the learning story beside, I want to tell you about my application to become a tour guide last year. That stuff did not hard as i thougt and i became a main guide after 2 months training and now I often do it once a week. That help me to earn litlle bit money

2019 summer vacation I saw a news for an AI internship at VNP. I applied and passed. At first I was really happy but became upset right after being offered for the job: JUST labeling data, classify data,... and the leader said that it was a part for the job, do that along with studying the algorithm. I did so but i really missed the chance to learn with the partner. After 5 months I quit. Although I could not study much in AI but I had a experience that may help me in the future- I hope so

It looked really boring but that was my year, this post was a mark as my lesson to try hard in the 2020. I hope that i could come back and say 2020 is better
